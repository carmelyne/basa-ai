# ðŸ“– Basa AI Playground

Basa AI is an open-source SvelteKit project designed to help improve reading comprehension skills among Filipino learners. Built for simplicity and offline-first compatibility using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), it enables users to:

- Paste a reading passage
- Select a target grade level
- Generate age-appropriate comprehension questions
- Optionally enable Bionic Reading to enhance focus and fluency

This tool was inspired by recent DepEd findings showing that many students graduate without achieving functional literacy. Basa AI aims to serve as a community-built interventionâ€”simple enough for classrooms, parents, and tutors to use, even in low-connectivity environments.
